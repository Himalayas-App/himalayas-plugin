description: Build and improve the user's Himalayas candidate profile, which drives job matches, tailored documents and how employers find them, by importing from LinkedIn or a resume, editing experience, education, skills, work permits, salary expectations and search status, and setting a photo, ID verification and email preferences. Use when the user wants to set up, import, review or update their Himalayas profile or account settings.

# Build the candidate profile

Follow [himalayas-basics](../himalayas-basics/SKILL.md) for the shared rules.
Profile tools need a Himalayas account.

## 1. Review what is there

Call `get_my_profile`. Report what is missing or weak for the user's goal:
primary role, location, work permits, salary expectations, search status,
experience with descriptions and skills, education, and tech stack.

## 2. Import (fastest for a new profile)

`import_profile` fills the profile from a LinkedIn profile URL or pasted resume
text. It runs in the background for a few minutes; call `get_my_profile`
afterwards to see the result.

- `append_only` adds what is missing and keeps what is there.
- `replace_all` overwrites the profile. Ask the user before using it.

## 3. Edit

- `update_profile`: name, bio, intro, location, `career_search_status`
  (`actively_searching`, `open_to_roles`, `closed_to_roles`), primary role,
  salary expectations, work permits and skills. Only the fields you pass
  change.
- `add_experience`, `update_experience`, `delete_experience` and the matching
  education tools take ids from `get_my_profile`. Deletes can't be undone.
- `update_tech_stack` replaces the list of tools and technologies. Names are
  matched to Himalayas' catalogue; unknown ones are requested for review.

Show the changes before writing them, then read the profile back.

## 4. Photo and verification

- `update_profile_photo` sets the avatar or cover photo from an https image
  URL (JPEG, PNG, WebP or GIF, up to 5 MB).
- `list_headshots` lists headshots the user already made on Himalayas, and
  `use_headshot_as_profile_photo` sets one as the photo. `get_headshots_link`
  returns the page where they make new ones.
- `get_verification_link` returns the next step for verifying the user's
  identity and work permits (the verified badge): the status, a verification
  link, or a checkout link. A passport or national ID verifies identity and the
  work permit for that country; a driver's licence verifies identity only. The
  user does the verification or payment on Stripe themselves.

## 5. Settings

- `update_email_preferences` turns Himalayas emails on or off; only the
  settings you pass change.
- `update_account` sets the account time zone used for email timing.
- Email address, password and account deletion can only be changed on
  himalayas.app.
